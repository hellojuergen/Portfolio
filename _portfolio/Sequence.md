Mount Blaser near Serles offered challenging freeride conditions — little snow, icy terrain, and difficult light. Despite this, I chose to shoot a sequence, deliberately moving away from a traditional approach. The camera position was never fixed; instead, both subject and camera remained in motion, making the movement itself an integral part of the work. The layering was created using varying ratios and contrasts, emphasizing depth and clearly revealing the camera’s own movement within the landscape.
