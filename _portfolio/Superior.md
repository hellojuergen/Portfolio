When taking a close look how society treats our surroundings, it is quite interesting that humans seem to feel superior to nature itself. Imagine that we are just bubbles in an aquarium which try to reach the surface. Equipped with natural & limited abilities of the human body the glass will always be a barrier. On top there might be an idea of the outside, but there is a different world which does exist in a different aggregation state. This physical boundary is reflected in the inabitlity to receive and process the majority of what is permanetly around and limits are set. Natures unwritten law is balance, nothing is superior. Life can only exist if death is also present. Yet we are blind to honor that adaption and acceptance are the most crucial parts of symmetry. In contrast humans try to compete with nature and seek to control it. This elementary bias in thought could be based in short term thinking as a lifetime is nothing compared to existance itself. Might this be the reason why society does not confront itself that symmetry must be focused on every level?

I guess balance hurts, as we all are just shadows, which need the sun to shine...
