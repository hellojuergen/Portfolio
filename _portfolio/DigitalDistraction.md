Half way sick, but still hooked. 
<br><br>
Do you know the feeling when you can't look away even if it is disturbing? 
<br>
The digital revolution made it more or less secretly socially acceptable. Disturbing content is all over the internet and access is easy. A fast way to distribute is via social media. By now, approximately half the world's population is connected and influenced by it. This has led to a never before seen potential to reach and connect an audience. Algorithms are used to filter content, based on user classification. Congruent communication boxes are made. This uniformity might be enchanting but it distraction of all. Still, outside of this box there is a real, unfiltered world with different opinions to handle.  
<br><br>
What is real?
